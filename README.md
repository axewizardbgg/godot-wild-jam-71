# Catacomb of Consequences

My entry for the 71st Godot Wild Jam that I made with my sons. We ended up placing 6th, which we were super pumped about! It was our first time participating in the Godot Wild Jam, and we loved it.

## Where can I play this?

You can find it on my itch.io and you can play it in the browser without having to download anything. Enjoy!

## Developer Notes

As is common with Game Jam submissions, the code contained herein may not be the cleanest, correct, or even sensible code, however it works. Feel free to poke around and see how I made it, my code is usually commented with what I was thinking at the time I wrote it. 

I made this in Godot v3.5.3, so if you try to run it with Godot 4, you'll need to tweak it.
